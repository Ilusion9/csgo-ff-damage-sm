# ConVars
```
mp_friendlyfire 1
ff_damage_reduction_bullets 0.33
ff_damage_reduction_grenade 0.85
ff_damage_reduction_grenade_self 1
ff_damage_reduction_other 0.4
```
The ff_ convars can be changed as you want, but be sure the friendly fire still works.
On default casual gamemode, mp_friendlyfire is enabled and all ff_ convars on 0. Even with mp_friendlyfire enabled, friendly fire doesn't work.
